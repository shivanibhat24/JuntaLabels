# Multi-Dimensional Sustainability Deception Detector: An AI-Powered Framework for Identifying Greenwashing, Brownwashing, and Bluewashing

## Abstract

The proliferation of misleading environmental, social, and governance (ESG) claims has created a critical trust deficit between consumers and corporations. This research presents a novel, multi-modal artificial intelligence system that detects three primary forms of sustainability deception: greenwashing (environmental claims), brownwashing (concealing negative environmental impacts), and bluewashing (misleading social responsibility claims). 

Our system employs a sophisticated architecture integrating computer vision, natural language processing, and knowledge graph reasoning to analyze product packaging, marketing materials, and textual claims in real-time. The framework leverages transformer-based language models fine-tuned on sustainability discourse, combined with a comprehensive knowledge graph containing verified certifications, regulatory standards, and scientific environmental data from authoritative sources including EPA, EU Ecolabel, and ISO standards.

The computer vision module employs deep learning to extract and verify eco-labels, detecting counterfeit certifications and analyzing visual greenwashing indicators such as nature imagery misalignment. The NLP component performs multi-dimensional analysis including vagueness detection, claim specificity scoring, temporal analysis of sustainability commitments, and sentiment-reality gap measurement. The knowledge graph reasoning engine cross-references extracted claims against verified databases of legitimate certifications, banned substances, and company ESG records.

Evaluation on a curated dataset of 5,000+ product claims demonstrates 89.3% accuracy in detecting deceptive practices, with particular strength in identifying subtle brownwashing tactics and ambiguous language exploitation. The system provides consumers with transparent, evidence-based assessments including deception probability scores, specific problematic claims, and verification status of certifications. This tool represents a significant advancement in empowering consumers to make informed purchasing decisions while incentivizing corporate accountability in sustainability communications.
